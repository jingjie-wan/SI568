However, nowadays, many people fail to keep a workout and healthy meal habits due to a lack of time, knowledge, and motivation. To solve this, this application makes detailed everyday workout and meal plans for users for free based on OpenAI API. \n",

    "Although there are plenty of similar applications in the market, this application has its advantage for being personalized by taking usersâ€™ physical condition, diet preferences, feedback, etc. into consideration, helping them persist in a healthy lifestyle without pain and extra efforts. Moreover, the application will provide restaurant recommendations which offers the menu components, making it easier for them to follow the meal plan."

    "1. A welcome message is shown on the screen. Then users would be asked to answer several questions based on their physical, fitness and meal information, including the height, weight, age, gender, disease, time for workout, special diet requirements, exercises the user like and doesn't like, etc.\n",
    "2. Based on the information, a workout and meal plan with the calories of each part and the nutrition ingredients is generated.The estimated Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and daily caloric goal are also included.\n",
    "3. The application would then ask for the user's feedback. If the user offers feedback, the application would generate a new plan which accomodate the user's feedback to make a better user experience and a more personalized plan.\n",
    "4. If the user want, the application will generate a list of restaurant offering the recommended foods in the meal plan, to make it easier for users to follow the meal plan if they have limited time.\n",
    "5. At the end, the application presents some motivational messages to encourage users keep healthy workout and diet habits."
